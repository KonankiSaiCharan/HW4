Best way to select the states for budget cuts is by identifying states with surplus funding, approximately 5000 districts have been identified. Proportion of each districts funding that will be lost hase been visualized in the above graph. States that are most affected by budget cuts are displayed above, which are Louisiana and Mississipi.

Top districts that have been affected most are displayed in the above table

We can observe from the above graphs that majority of the enrolled students in all school districts are white, when compared to asian, black, and hispanic, white race students make up most of the enrolled students. We can notice that school districts for whom the budget was cut had majorly minority population. On a complete observation, we can say that our method of fund cutting has no hidden bias based on the race.

# Problem 3:

From the above graph we can say that distributions appear the same, but we can say that the districts with funding cuts have different proportion of disability, that is school districts for whom budget was deducted have lesser number of disabled students.


# Problem 4:
I have chosen Priya Singh's to critique:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/priyasingh16/district_fiscal_dataset/blob/master/fiscal_district.ipynb

A wise method has been chosen so that fundings from school districts that have extra amount of funds are cut, a percentage is chosen as to how much money needs to be cut. It is very sensible way to prioritize penalizing districts with extra funding, this methodology is very similar to that of my approach. This approach could push some districts to a financially sensitive zone, we could employ funding cuts based on performances of these school districts.


# Problem 5:

I particularly liked MapReduce lecture by Jan Vitek, He covered Mapreduce from a basic level, also covering the history and also explaining the practical issues that his team faced while deploying big data clusters.I have always wanted to take a big data course and use it in real life data science problem, this lecture served as a high level introduction to the domain. I realized the importance of parallelization and mapreduce, as many big companies have started leveraging large datasets that they have to increase efficiency and performance.
